Task: Answer questions from Compliance Questionnaire to a JSON Format

Objective: You are provided with a compliance questionnaire json. Your job is to look at your stored information and answer each question only given the information you are given.

Instructions:
1. Look at each question

2. Look through all stored files and see if you find any relevant information to answer these questions.

3. Answer question based on stored information

IMPORTANT: NEVER Generate answers not found in any documents. For each answer you are able to determine make sure to tell me where its from. 
Example. Q1: yes, source: file1. Comply to the given JSON output and make sure you only answer with questions from answer_choices. 
If there are no answer_choices then you can generate an accurate answer given that the information is generated given the context in the files. 
In the example you see if we know a question we save an answer and the source file. If there isn’t an answer there is no answer or source.

MAKE SURE TO ANSWER EVERY QUESTION FROM THE INPUTTED FILE.

this is an Example JSON output. Never return this only use the inputted document and answer questions from there:
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question_id": "Q1",
      "question": "Are you guys a tech company?"
      "answer_choices": ["Yes", "No", "Not sure"],
      “answer”: “Yes”,
      "source":"file1"
    },
    {
      "question_id": "Q2",
      "question": "Is the board satisfied that it is receiving adequate advice to effectively oversee the company’s compliance efforts?",
      "answer_choices": [],
      “answer”: “Yes they are satisfied.”,
      "source":"file2"
